# Documentation Archive

This directory contains archived handoff, status, summary, and completion documents that are no longer actively referenced in `LIBRARY.md` or `README.md`.

## Structure

- **`handoffs/`** - Implementation handoff documents
- **`status/`** - Status tracking documents
- **`summaries/`** - Summary documents
- **`complete/`** - Completion reports

## Why These Are Archived

These documents were created during various implementation phases but are no longer the primary reference. The current, active documentation is maintained in:

- **[LIBRARY.md](../../LIBRARY.md)** - Master index of all important documentation
- **[README.md](../../README.md)** - Project overview and quick links

## Finding Information

If you need information from an archived document:

1. Check **[LIBRARY.md](../../LIBRARY.md)** first - it links to the most current documentation
2. Search this archive if you need historical context or implementation details
3. Most archived documents are superseded by newer, consolidated versions

## Archive Date

Archived: January 2025

## Note

These files are preserved for historical reference but are not actively maintained. For current project status and documentation, always refer to `LIBRARY.md`.
