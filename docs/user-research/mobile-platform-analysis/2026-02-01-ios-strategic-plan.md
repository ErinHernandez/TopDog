# iOS & Mobile Platform Strategic Plan

**Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Status:** Final  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive strategic plan for mobile platform decisions

## Part 1: Why This Company Exists

### The Origin Story

This company was born from betrayal.

A power user - someone who had optimized their fantasy football workflow with a dedicated draft phone - had their setup bricked when Underdog pushed an iOS update that dropped support for older devices.

The response wasn't to upgrade the phone. It was fury. The phone has been off for 18 months.

The response was to quit a job, invest entire savings, and build a competitor.

**This company exists because someone else wasn't fanatical about their users.**

### The Core Value

**Fanatical about the user.**

This isn't a marketing slogan. It's the founding principle. Every decision - including iOS version support - flows from this value.

---

## Part 2: The Business Thesis

### Primary Thesis

**Global demand for fantasy football is underestimated.**

The market data supports this:
- Global fantasy sports: $42B → $80B by 2031 (13.66% CAGR)
- Mobile fantasy: 64.6% of revenue, growing at 14.21% CAGR
- NFL international viewership: Record highs, 32% YoY growth
- NFL expanding to UK, Germany, Africa, Brazil, Australia

But the data isn't why we believe this. We believe it because we see what others don't.

### Secondary Thesis

**The incumbents aren't fanatical about their users.**

Underdog proved this. They optimized for their convenience over user experience. They're not alone - the industry treats users as metrics, not people.

**Competitive advantage: Actually caring about users.**

---

## Part 3: Target Markets

### Geographic Scope

**The world is the target. Everywhere is a priority.**

Excluding: India and China (legal/operational constraints)

### Markets

No tiers. No prioritization. Every market gets full support.

| Region | Markets | iOS Approach |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **North America** | USA, Canada, Mexico | Full support |
| **Europe** | UK, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Rest of Europe | Full support |
| **South America** | Brazil, Rest of Latin America | Full support |
| **Africa** | Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, Egypt, Rest of Africa | Full support |
| **Asia Pacific** | Australia, Southeast Asia, Middle East | Full support |

**Why no tiers?**

Tiers imply some users matter more than others. They don't. The thesis is that global demand is underestimated. We can't prove that by prioritizing some markets over others.

A user in Nigeria is as important as a user in New York. A user in Kenya is as important as a user in London. 

That's what "fanatical about the user" means.

### User Prioritization

**All users are priority users.**

If we must segment for product decisions:

| Segment | Description | Value |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Power users** | Multiple leagues, dedicated setups, draft phones | Highest - they're our advocates |
| **Serious players** | Regular engagement, 1-3 leagues | High - core revenue |
| **Casual players** | Occasional engagement | Medium - growth potential |
| **New to fantasy** | First-time players | High - prove global thesis |

## Part 4: iOS Version Decision

### The Recommendation

**iOS 16+ minimum. Consider iOS 15+ based on user needs.**

### The Rationale

This decision is not based on optimizing a spreadsheet. It's based on values.

| Factor | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **Power users have draft phones** | Many on iPhone 8/X (iOS 16 max) |
| **Emerging markets have older devices** | Support them |
| **We don't know every user's situation** | Default to inclusion |
| **Development overhead** | Cost worth paying |
| **Underdog dropped support and lost us** | Don't repeat their mistake |
| **Fanatical about the user** | Support their devices |

### What This Means Technically

| iOS Version | Support | Devices Included |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **iOS 16+** | ✅ Full | iPhone 8, X, and newer (~94% of iOS) |
| iOS 15 | ⚠️ Evaluate | iPhone 6s, 7, SE1 (~97% of iOS) |
| iOS 14 and older | ❌ No | Very old devices (~3% of iOS) |

### Coverage

| iOS Minimum | Global Coverage | Devices |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| iOS 16+ | 94.1% | ~1.41B |
| iOS 15+ | 96.8% | ~1.45B |

### The Draft Phone Case

Power users in the US often use an old iPhone as a dedicated draft device:
- iPhone 8 (2017) - iOS 16 max
- iPhone X (2017) - iOS 16 max
- iPhone 7 (2016) - iOS 15 max

**These are our best users.** Supporting iOS 16 means supporting their setups.

If we discover significant users on iOS 15 devices, we support iOS 15.

### Decision Framework for Future

When making iOS support decisions:

| Question | Wrong Answer | Right Answer |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| "Should we drop iOS X?" | "The data says those users are low value" | "Do any of our users need it?" |
| "It would speed up development" | "Let's do it" | "What's the user impact?" |
| "Only 2% of users are affected" | "That's acceptable" | "That's thousands of real people" |

## Part 5: Competitive Positioning

### vs. Underdog

| Underdog | Us |
|----------|-----|
| Dropped iOS support, bricked setups | Support your draft phone |
| Optimized for their convenience | Optimized for user experience |
| Users are metrics | Users are people |
| Created a furious former customer | Created by that customer |

### The Message

To serious fantasy players:

> "We support your setup. We won't brick your draft phone. We're building this because we're one of you."

### Competitive Advantages

1. **User obsession** - Actually caring, not just saying it
2. **Global vision** - Believing in underestimated demand
3. **Founder story** - Built by a betrayed power user
4. **Technical inclusion** - Supporting older devices
5. **Africa strategy** - First mover in growing market

## Part 8: Decision Framework

### For All Product Decisions

When facing any product decision, ask:

1. **What do our users need?**
2. **What would a company fanatical about users do?**
3. **What would we have wanted Underdog to do?**

### For iOS/Technical Decisions

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Do users need this? | Support it | Still consider it |
| Does dropping it hurt users? | Don't drop it | Evaluate carefully |
| Are we optimizing for us or them? | Check ourselves | Proceed |

### For Market Decisions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is there demand? | If we believe there is, pursue it |
| Is it proven? | We're here to prove underestimated demand |
| Can we serve them well? | If not yet, build until we can |

## Part 9: The Stakes

### What We're Building

Not just an app. A company that proves:
- Users can come first
- Global demand exists
- A betrayed customer can become a competitor
- Caring about people is a business advantage

### What Failure Looks Like

Becoming what we're fighting against:
- Optimizing for convenience over users
- Treating users as metrics
- Making decisions that brick someone's setup
- Forgetting why we started

### What Success Looks Like

- Users feel heard and supported
- Power users are our biggest advocates
- Global fantasy demand is proven
- We never betray a user the way we were betrayed

---

## Part 10: Summary

### The iOS Decision

**iOS 16+ minimum.**

Not because the data optimizes for it. Because our users need it.

### The Business Thesis

**Global fantasy football demand is underestimated.** We're here to prove it.

### The Core Value

**Fanatical about the user.** Every decision flows from this.

### The Origin

**We exist because someone wasn't fanatical about their user.** We won't make that mistake.
