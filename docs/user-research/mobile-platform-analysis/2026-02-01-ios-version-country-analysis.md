## 7. Enterprise Recommendations

### Minimum iOS Version Strategy

| Strategy | Min iOS | Coverage | Trade-offs |
|----------|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aggressive (Recommended for new apps)** | iOS 17+ | 89.5% | Modern APIs, less legacy code, good reach |
| **Balanced** | iOS 16+ | 94.1% | Broader reach, some legacy support |
| **Maximum Reach** | iOS 15+ | 96.8% | Significant legacy overhead |

### App Store Requirements (Critical Dates)

| Date | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **April 24, 2025** | Must build with Xcode 16 / iOS 18 SDK |
| **April 2026** | Must build with iOS 26 SDK |

*Note: Building with iOS 18 SDK doesn't mean iOS 18 is the minimum deployment target—you can still support older iOS versions.*

### Regional Prioritization Matrix

## 8. Key Takeaways for Enterprise Decision

1. **iOS 17+ as minimum is optimal** for new enterprise applications, providing 89.5% coverage with modern API access

2. **iPhone 13 is the dominant device** in the installed base (15.29%)—ensure your app performs well on A15 Bionic

3. **Regional fragmentation is significant**—China and emerging markets have higher proportions of older iOS versions

4. **Device retention is increasing**—3.2 year average upgrade cycle means planning for 3-4 year device support windows

5. **Premium user concentration**—iOS users skew higher income (61% of >$50K earners), which may affect pricing strategy

6. **Geographic concentration**—~60% of iOS users are in US, China, Europe, and Japan. Prioritize these markets

7. **Android consideration**—For emerging markets (Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America), Android should be primary platform with iOS as secondary

8. **iOS 26 adoption is accelerating**—Currently at ~14%, expected to reach 50% faster than previous versions per Apple data

## Appendix A: Data Quality Notes

- TelemetryDeck data from 16M MAU across ~7,000 apps may skew toward certain app categories
- StatCounter tracks web traffic, which may differ from app usage patterns
- Safari anti-fingerprinting caused some iOS 26 traffic to be misreported as iOS 18.6/18.7 (largely corrected)
- Emerging market data has higher uncertainty due to lower sample sizes
- Enterprise-specific data is limited; corporate deployment patterns may differ from consumer patterns
