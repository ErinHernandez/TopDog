## Known Data Quality Issues

1. **Safari Anti-Fingerprinting:** Apple's privacy changes initially caused iOS 26 to be misreported as iOS 18.6/18.7 in some analytics. Corrections have been applied but some historical data may be affected.

2. **Sample Bias:** TelemetryDeck's sample skews toward indie/smaller apps. Enterprise app usage patterns may differ.

3. **Web vs App Traffic:** StatCounter measures web traffic. Mobile app usage patterns may differ significantly.

4. **Emerging Market Uncertainty:** Data from Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America has higher uncertainty due to smaller sample sizes and informal device markets.

5. **Enterprise vs Consumer:** Most data sources track consumer behavior. Enterprise/corporate device deployment patterns are less well-documented.
