# To get the real file:
# 1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Settings > Payment Methods > Apple Pay
# 2. Click "Add new domain"
# 3. Download the domain verification file
# 4. Replace this file's contents with the downloaded file contents

# The file should contain a long verification string from Apple/Stripe.
